# poketerm maybe pokeshell? pts for now
there are more poketerm projects than pokeshell projects

Need frontend
- random
    with specific gens
    use random like a placeholder and expand later
    delimit on comma for random gen (how to do range) [1-6]
    `random-1,6`
- add autocomplete for flags
- add autocomplete for pokemon
- for 404 use question mark unknown (when exactly: no poke (mispelling) found,
no female version/male version found)

other cool stuff:
    use random unown (instead of default) if not specified unown-a/b etc
    # gen 6 loved their forms
    use random vivillon
    use random flabebe, floette, florges
    use random furfrou
    use random pumpkaboo, gourgeist
    # gen 7
    use random oricorio
    use random lycanroc
    use random minior
    # gen 8
    use random alcremie
    use random urshifu, zarude

    2 hard
    everytime spinda shows up use random spinda art:
    https://github.com/msikma/spinda-spots for small sprites
    what about larger ones? idk

gotta wait for new gifs from projectpokemon to be part of pokeapi, till then
use different source for gif (projectpokemon) and another one for img (pokeapi)
also gotta wait for shiny sprites to be part of pokeapi from msikma/pokesprite
pokeapi has messed up entry for meowstic

get upstream issues to track them

separate img/gif magick from curl call/frontend
frontend should just pull in the img/gifs
this list is passed to backend code
