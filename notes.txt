What's the name? pts?

is it worth syncing to average frame than min frame?

Need frontend
- dex num and name
    with variants specify name with variants modifier i.e. pikachu-megax
    with variants specify dex num with variants modifier
    i.e. 25-megax == pikachu-megax
    note keep variants modifier as text since nums are hard
    this might be a bit more dependent on the url of how we are fetching img tho
    with shiny prefix it i.e. shiny-pikachu, shiny-pikachu-megax, shiny-25,
    also allow s-24 or s-pikachu
    delimit on the dash for what kind of poke or maybe use forward slash to
    match pokeapi url?
    delimit on space for pokes
- random
    with specific gens and small chance of shiny and bit more chance of variants
    use random like a placeholder and expand later
    i.e. pts random -> pts pikachu or pts shiny-pikachu if lucky
    delimit on comma for random gen (how to do range) [1-6]
    `random-1,6`
    can also force random shinies,
    `shiny-random-1,6`
    can't specify random forms tho, maybe u can idk?
    maybe `shiny-random-1,6-mega` or `random-1,6-alolan`
- small sprites
    this is flag to make all specified pokes use small art
    pokeapi doesn't have small shiny sprites either,
    use https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite

of course this is a list (keep on adding to display more pokes!)

other cool stuff:
    use random male/female unless specified
    use random unown (instead of default) if not specified unown-a/b etc
    # gen 6 loved their forms
    use random vivillon
    use random flabebe, floette, florges
    use random furfrou
    use random pumpkaboo, gourgeist
    # gen 7
    use random oricorio
    use random lycanroc
    use random minior
    # gen 8
    use random alcremie
    use random urshifu, zarude

    2 hard
    everytime spinda shows up use random spinda art:
    https://github.com/msikma/spinda-spots for small sprites
    what about larger ones? idk

deps:
frontend: bash, curl
backend: bash imagemagick catimg/timg

update imagemagick calls? convert -> magick

gotta wait for new gifs from projectpokemon to be part of pokeapi, till then
use different source for gif (projectpokemon) and another one for img (pokeapi)
also gotta wait for shiny sprites to be part of pokeapi from msikma/pokesprite

get issues to track them

separate img/gif magick from curl call/frontend
frontend should just pull in the img/gifs
this list is passed to backend code
