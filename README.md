## Similar Projects
pts is not the first player in the pokemon shell art niche and nor will it
be the last. (I just hope that the next project can take these ideas and only
expand on them.) Below is a short description of the two projects,
[phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts) &
[talwat/pokeget](https://github.com/talwat/pokeget), that also fill this role and what
makes pts unique among them.
